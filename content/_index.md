    <h2 class="c-heading">Why we are starting the Open VoIP Alliance</h2>
    <p>As a part of Devhouse Spindle, a company developing open communication products, we see different open source communities and products working towards the same goal: to have free and open VoIP communication. What we donâ€™t see, however, is a <mark>common place for discussions or collaboration</mark> on projects that can help the progression of VoIP technology as a whole. To solve this, we want to create the Open VoIP Alliance. Through this alliance, we aim to <mark>connect smaller communities and businesses</mark>. Together we can lower the barriers for developing VoIP technologies.</p>
    <h2 class="c-heading">How you can help</h2>
    <p>This alliance is in the beginning stages of formation. We are looking for people that believe in our mission and want to join us from the very beginning to make this alliance a thriving place where VoIP developers and enthusiasts can connect, discuss, and collaborate.</p>
    <div class="c-content">
      <h3 class="c-heading c-heading-small">The mission guiding our efforts</h3>
      <p>Our mission is to boost collaboration within the VoIP space to stimulate advances in the way people communicate. We believe that in an era where cutting edge technology is developed in the open, working together is more important than ever. Through the combination of our globally distributed efforts, we can evolve the field in ways still unimaginable.</p>
      <h3 class="c-heading c-heading-small">Why open source?</h3>
      <p>In effort to reduce redundancy and deduplicate the current efforts of people in VoIP, we are creating a space for collaboration regardless of your professional background and level of VoIP knowledge. Our foundation for the community is open source software. By using this open form of development, every member is able to discuss problems or collaborate on projects without limitations.</p>
